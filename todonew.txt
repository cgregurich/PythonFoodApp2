TODO:
- make calcdailyamounts work
#######- add total cost to top of calcdailyamounts
- add number of units needed to calcdailyamounts (rounded? not rounded? both? idk)

########- fix weird column length bug

############- make need calculation work, order 

############- format cost column to be currency 



##########- add padding to bottom of view products page

######### - im pretty sure total is calculating the wrong thing; i think it's the sum
of the columns in cost/unit; it should be sum of columns in actual cost

############# - total isn't updating when something changes (not sure if that's a problem related to above,
or if there's a problem in the code)

- does changing ss reflect changes in rest of db (macro changes, etc)

- columns not wide enough after adding foods ????

#####- create validation for inventory cells in calc daily amount page
###############- if inventory cell is empty, make it 0
