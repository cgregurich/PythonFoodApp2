working on GUI
where I left off: figured out I should just create a pseudo spreadsheet for viewing foods
finish implementing the construction of this pseudo sheets i.e. new_row function, display data to this sheet
also an idea: a check box for editable, a save button, etc. 

5-28-20
try .md format for todo file


obv need to add functionality for refreshing/updating the sheet as far as actual data goes. i.e. change a macro, show it when opening the window; currently that works by hitting refresh but that's because the entire window is redrawn


EPIPHANY: how to create meals: display the food sheet with checkboxes along the side. Check the foods that you want to put in the meal. Once done, click "Continue" button. Next screen it will show each food name with an Entry sandwiched between the name of the food and the unit of the food. Enter the amount of the food that the meal contains. Click Continue. It'll proportionalize all the foods, and display the meal, add the meal to the meals (WIP), etc. Potentially (most likely) need to add a search bar as well, ideally with an instant search (how tf does that work??) instead of manually finding each food and all that. 



Next I need to make sure that I can update information and click save changes and it'll actually save. How tf do i do that? How do I make it so I can change the name of an item? Maybe create a duplicate list of entries or fooditems and check the index of an item with another and if the index is the same then update that item in the DB. This means the delete functionality will have to be separate, because otherwise there'd be no way to tell if an item was deleted (and thus the below item slid up one row) or if the item was simply updated i.e. name was changed, so it looks like a new item. 

Then I need to figure out how to delete things (delete mode? Make check boxes appear next to items?)

todo: once i figure out this whole cell business, make sure all that I did also takes place when creating a new cell, either through the AddFood page or through the new row button (WIP)

EPIPHANY: two (or more?) ways of viewing all foods: the default spreadsheet style view, and a "singular" view, where you can view the foods one by one, similar to an AddFood form, so you can more easily see the information? Idk might not be necessary. If you do this, obv implement a search and maybe even an alphabet at the top you can click on to jump to a letter


todo: might have to refactor FoodItem method proportionalize() to deal with the fact that some pieces of info might be Strings instead of integers/floats, i.e. foods created from the sheet when updating the DB i.e. using the FoodItem method set_info_from_string_list()

^^^ potentially fixed by creating numberize method??

WHERE I LEFT OFF: just completed the functionality to be able to edit cells in the pseudosheet. It seems to work after ironing out a bug that creating some issues (was adding more rows to self.entries, yet gridding them to the same 15 rows over and over so list index errors... got it fixed. booter sket). Next step besides obv trying to identify bugs and stuff, maybe the delete functionality? Open a delete mode where checkboxes appear next to each row, check them, hit delete (or cancel) and delete the rows, updating the db and class vars accordingly. 


# todo delete functionality
# todo scrolling functionality (something about a canvas??)
# todo make sure the AddFood page works in conjunction with the current pseudo sheets
# todo a new row option in DisplayAllFoods as another option for adding new foods to the sheet
# todo find out more todos to todo doo doo doo doot doot  do, doodoo
# todo sort functionality

#? refresh button not needed anymore?

#todo deal with duplicate food names (i.e. forbid it? not sure if necessary)


EPIPHANY: if all the entries in a row are empty, obv that food should be deleted. So if all the info of a food in the sheet (i.e. a row) is empty, remove that from self.all_foods and from the sheet

#TODO DEAL WITH DUPLICATE NAMES!!!!!!!

# todo adding food from add_foods page doesn't show up on DisplayAllFoods; i think it's an issue with the reset method of DisplayAllFoods


WHERE I LEFT OFF: was able to make it work where if a food was added on the AddFoods page, then that food is drawn to the sheet without redrawing the entire sheet. Need to now make it so that deleting rows works when I make each cell empty; this technically works, but the sheet is not redrawn yet. If I do this then restart the application, the row is gone and it's deleted from the DB. The trick is to getting it to be drawn.

BUG: when deleting things not in order (not sure which order it wants) there's an issue with indices. Also, it shouldn't popup a messagebox for each item deleted. SO next step: figure out how to delete things. I think delete mode is kind of out, this will work better, potentially, Idk delete mode could still be useful.

BUG: when there are no foods in the db, obv it has an issue drawing the sheets. implement an add_row method, and just call that if there are no foods in the db. 

WHERE I LEFT OFf:: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. not sure what's happening. I'm trying to get delete functionality to work. And when there are three or more items and the item being deleted is not the top or the bottom, it seems to work out okay. but if it's top or bottom item, the row doesn't disappear... not sure why. Also some errors in the console...hm...... 
I take that back. only when deleting from the bottom is there issues. Also need to fix the issue where there are no fooditems in the db, because the code doesn't like trying to deal with a None type (gotta pinpoint where that None type is coming from..) i think its from self.all_foods being empty. DEAL WITH THIS



JUNE 1st:
decided to switch to using tkintertable API instead of trying to bojangle my own. need to go through the above todos to figure out what is still relevant...
anywho a new one:

TODO: fix the entry widgets in the AddFoods page; they don't tab when you hit tab. but also, this page may be irrelevant since I'm using tkintertable now

TODO:
delete functionality (clear a row of info, and hit save -> delete that food from the DB)

EPIPHANY:
when creating meals, have an "add ingredient" button, which will make an optionmenu appear, and it contains all the names of the fooditems in the db



TKINTER TABLE CAN SUCK MY BALLS
SWITCHED TO DO MY OWN THING YET AGAIN 6-4-20:

things to test:
-adding a new food with a longer name adjusts the column width
-removing the foods with the longest names adjusts the column width
-validate all aspects of adding a new food
-ask user to save changes before going back???

Things to do:
-Fix all designed errors to be similar (display row and col if possible, clean output)

-Make calculate macros page. Why? Idk i feel like it and it'll probably help me figure out how to make the meals page.
-Figure out best way to show the options for foods to choose from; investigate a ComboBox

WTF
wtf displayallfoods was working fine now it's not working????
debug boi

figure out how to destroy rows without getting this weird bug, has to do with looping through a list that you're modifying

pretty much go through all the fancy schmancy delete_row functions and EXORCISE THEM. Do like the reset() func is currently like instead!

6-6-20:

in MealsPage: uhhhh maybe just maybe don't allow user to add a new adder unless all the current ones are used?? DONE
^^^^ this is kind of an annoying feature, because it's much easier to click the button a handful of times at once then add the foods instead
of going back and forth back and forth

todo: need to test valid and invalid inputs in meals
todo: obv write meals to the db
todo: fix weird rounding display for meal macros
FIXED I THINKtodo: fix add food button only allowing you to do it once 

6-6-20: (not sure why it says 6-6-20 above)
IT MAY BE CALLED MealsPageOld but it's the form I want to go with the most, so figure that out.
